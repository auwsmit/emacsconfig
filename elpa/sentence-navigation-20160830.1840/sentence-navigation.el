;;; sentence-navigation.el --- Commands to navigate one-spaced sentences.

;; Author: Fox Kiester <noct@openmailbox.org>
;; URL: https://github.com/noctuid/emacs-sentence-navigation
;; Package-Version: 20160830.1840
;; Keywords: sentence evil
;; Package-Requires: ((ample-regexps "0.1") (cl-lib "0.5") (emacs "24.4"))
;; Version: 0.1

;;; Commentary:
;; This package gives commands for sentence navigation and manipulation
;; that ignore abbreviations. For example, in a sentence that contains
;; "Mr. MacGyver", "MacGyver" will not be considered to be the start of
;; a sentence. One-spaced sentences are the target of this plugin, but
;; it will also work properly with two-spaced sentences.

;; This package is inspired by vim-textobj-sentence and uses a modified
;; version of its default regex list. Evil is an optional dependency
;; that is used for the text objects this package provides.

;; For more information see the README in the github repo.

able to distinguish between a sentence that starts at the beginning of a line
and a capitalized word (such as a name) at the beginning of the line.

When non-nil, the provided commands will work correctly for both soft-wrapped
and hard-wrapped sentences provided that `sentence-nav-non-sentence-line-alist'
is properly customized for the current major mode. A capital letter at the
beginning of a line will only be considered to be the start of the sentence if
the previous line is a newline, ends with a sentence end, or matches one of the
regexps for the current major mode in `sentence-nav-non-sentence-line-alist'."

Each regexp describes a line that is not a sentence but can directly precede
one. For example, one of the default regexps is for an org heading. This regexp
lets this package know that if there is a capital letter on a line following an
org heading, it can be assumed that the capital letter starts a sentence. This
means checking the previous line for a sentence ending character won't be
necessary.

non-nil.")
