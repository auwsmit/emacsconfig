* What is this?

This is my emacs config. I'm trying out this
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org-babel]] thing.
Basically my init file is one huge org file with blocks of elisp code sprinkled
throughout. Those blocks are evaluated by org-babel on startup.

* How do I view it?

GitHub can read =.org= files and render them nicely, but since the file is so
long, I recommend viewing it in org-mode where things are collapsible.

* Why =org-babel=?

*Benefits*:

- *all* settings in one file
- everything is hierarchically organized
- (mostly) everything is explained
- org-mode features are available
- it's fun
